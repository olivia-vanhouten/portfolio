                            <p>For this project, I was tasked to create a tribute page.  I chose no other than the first dog to go to space, Laika.  This project included a title, picture, caption to the picture, a brief summary, and a link an external website with more information (This one links to wikipedia).  This project was again done before I leanred responsive web design, so the project may not work on smaller screens.</p>

A statue was built in her name in 2008 and she has been honored in various other art-forms as well by people all over the world.</p>

                            <p>For the 3rd project, I had to make some sort of technical documentation to work with CSS layouts.  I chose the 12 Principles of Animation, as it is a topic I was very familiar with.  I worked with responsive web design to make the webpage mobile friendly and learned about fixed and sticky positioning.</p>

      <section id="Squash_and_Stretch" class="main-section">
        <header>Squash and Stretch</header>
        <p>Squash and Stretch is one of the first things taught in animation.  This principle involves a figure stretching in it's movement.  Think of a bouncing ball.  When it hits the ground, the impact makes the ball squash slightly.  When it goes back up, it reacts by stretching vertically.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Anticipation" class="main-section">
        <header>Anticipation</header>
        <p>
          Anticipation involves creating action before the main action.  For example, if you were to throw a ball, your arm would have to come back to prepare for the throw.  Having anticipation allows for the actions to seem more natural.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Staging" class="main-section">
        <header>Staging</header>
        <p>
          Staging involves how the scene is set up.  Where is the character placed, or how does the viewer see the character?  Shadows and light can add to this as well.  Using something to lead the viewers eye to the animation allows for clarity.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Straight_Ahead_and_Pose_to_Pose" class="main-section">
        <header>Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose</header>
        <p>
          Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose are two different styles of approaching actually animating a character.  Stright Ahead involves drawing one frame and then moving onto the next.  This method is good for effects or warping shapes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pose to Pose involves drawing what are called keyframes first.  Keyframes are the large and important poses of the animation.  Once those are done, the frames between the keyframes (inbetweens) are done.  This method is better for keeping shape and size consistant.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Follow_Through_and_Overlapping_Action" class="main-section">
        <header>Follow Through and Overlapping Action</header>
        <p>
          Follow Through and Overlapping Action are two key ideas that lead to the same effect.  This principle involves having parts of the character move AFTER the main movement is finished.  Think of a ponytail.  When someone with a ponytail runs and then stops moving, the ponytail continues to move slightly after that person stops.  This helps make characters more dynamic and improves overall flow.
        </p>
      </section>
  <section id="Slow_In_and_Slow_Out" class="main-section">
        <header>Slow In and Slow Out</header>
        <p>
          Slow In and Slow Out help movement feel less robotic.  When something starts to move, it takes effort to start, meaning that movement is slower.  A similar thing happens when something comes to a stop, it needs to slow down to release momentum before fully stopping.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Arc" class="main-section">
        <header>Arc</header>
        <p>
          Arc involves how things move.  While some things move in a straight line, a lot move in curves or arcs.  When a person is walking, their leg doesn't move in a straight line.  It bends and moves in a curve relative to the persons body.  A similar thing happens with the arms.  Much of this is caused by objects being a fixed length.  If you move something forward that is attached to an unmoving point, it has to also move either up or down, or, in an arc.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Secondary_Action" class="main-section">
        <header>Secondary Action</header>
        <p>
          Secondary Action is a principle similar to Follow Through and Overlapping Action.  This principle simpily involves having more than one thing moving at a time.  Say a person is waving.  The main action may be the person putting their arm up to wave.  A secondary action could be them smiling at the person they are waving at.  Secondary action like this makes things feel more alive and natural.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Timing" class="main-section">
        <header>Timing</header>
        <p>
          Timing is increadibly important to animation.  When improperly timed, movements look stiff.  Having frames or poses spaced farther or closer from each other leads to visual interest.  In general, faster movements involve father poses, while slower movements have poses closer together.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Exaggeration" class="main-section">
        <header>Exaggeration</header>
        <p>
          Exaggeration is what makes animation special.  Without the limits of reality, animators can push things beyond what is physically possible to show emotion.  Bigger, larger actions catch the eye of the audience and makes animations easier to read.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Solid_Drawing" class="main-section">
        <header>Solid Drawing</header>
        <p>
          Solid Drawing is the least animation-related out of the principles.  In order to animate, a person must have an understanding of how to draw objects, especially in a 3D space.  Learning how to draw and studying anatomy and shape help improve this aspect of animation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Appeal" class="main-section">
        <header>Appeal</header>
        <p>
          Appeal is the most subjective animation principle.  Different people find different things appealing.  What one person likes isn't always the same as another.  Finding an audiance to appeal to and making the animation with that in mind makes animations worth watching.

I needed an email list sign-up, about section, and a pricing section.  I used a lot of positioning styles and learned more about how to develop responsive web design and user-friendly pages.</p>
